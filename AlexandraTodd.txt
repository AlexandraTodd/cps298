Hello, I'm Alexandra Todd and I work with LSA Technology Services at the University of Michigan. I work on the Instructional Computing team and we manage classroom, lab and loan machines, and try to keep them as synchronous as possible. I’m taking Team Programming to finish my Information Systems: Programming in C++ Associate, although there are certainly still courses I’m interested in taking. I live with my sweet cat, Kendrick (LaMeow), and my partner, Oliver. I grew up in Ann Arbor and attended Pioneer, so this is home for me. I’m hoping to delve into making apps as a hobby, and so I’m excited for the opportunity to do so alongside others who have a shared interest.
