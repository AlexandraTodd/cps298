Hi guys, this is my introduction text file.

My name is Justin Kim. I was born in Seoul, and moved to the states when I was a baby.
I've lived in Boston, LA, but grew up in Ann Arbor since 3rd grade.

I lived in the Ann Arbor area until 2017, when I moved to Indianapolis, and moved back
here in 2019. I currently live in Milan.

I have a yorkie named Nismo and a black cat named Kelpo.

In my free time I love playing video games and working on cars.

I've worked for T-Mobile for around 8 years, and currently am a retail manager.
I am finishing up my associates in computer science--java programming.
I would say that I'm not super technical, but hope to eventually find a role that is
more geared towards the business/sales side of software.
